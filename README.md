# Welcome to our Training

This part of Github is a project to help you learn about robotics and programming... especially programming robots.

Most of the *good stuff* can be found on our [Wiki Training Pages](https://github.com/Pigmice2733/Robotics-Class/wiki), where we all collaborate on writing and organizing all the information that a new member of our Pigmice Team can learn to get started and contribute.

**Note:** You will not need to need to *clone* this project, as we do not have any source code or other files to deal with.
